## üí° Best Practices

### Before Backup
1. **Clean up unnecessary files** - Remove caches and temporary data
2. **Update software** - Ensure latest versions are captured
3. **Document manual configurations** - Note any manual system tweaks
4. **Test dry run** - Verify what will be backed up

### During Restore
1. **Start with essentials** - Restore shell and development tools first
2. **Validate each step** - Check configurations work before proceeding
3. **Review security settings** - Manually verify system preferences
4. **Test applications** - Ensure restored configs work properly

### After Restore
1. **Re-authenticate services** - Sign back into AWS, GitHub, etc.
2. **Verify SSH keys** - Test SSH connections
3. **Check application licenses** - Re-activate software as needed
4. **Update system** - Install any pending macOS updates

## üõ† Advanced Usage

### Backup Validation
```bash
# Validate backup contents without restoring
./scripts/enhanced-restore.sh backup.tar.gz --validate
```

### Selective Application Restore
When selecting "Application Configurations", you'll get a submenu to choose specific apps:
```
Available application configurations:
  [1] AWS CLI (.aws)
  [2] Docker (.docker)
  [3] VS Code (.vscode)
  [4] iTerm2 (.iterm2)
  ...
```

### Launch Agent Management
When selecting "Launch Agents", choose specific services:
```
Available launch agents:
  [1] com.example.myservice.plist
  [2] homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
  ...
```

### System Information Review
```bash
# View captured system information
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz
cat user_profile_backup_*/system_info/backup_summary.txt
```

## üìã Backup Contents

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backup too large**
- Review what's being backed up with dry run
- Exclude cache directories (already done automatically)
- Consider selective backup of large app configs

**Restore fails**
- Validate backup first: `--validate` flag
- Check disk space on target system
- Ensure proper permissions on target directories

**Applications don't work after restore**
- Re-authenticate with services
- Check application licenses
- Verify file permissions
- Restart applications

**Launch agents don't start**
- Review agent files before loading
- Use `launchctl load` manually
- Check system logs for errors

### Getting Help

```bash
# Detailed help for restore script
./scripts/enhanced-restore.sh --help

# View backup contents
tar -tzf backup_archive.tar.gz | head -20

# Check system compatibility
cat backup_directory/system_info/backup_summary.txt
```

## üîÑ Migration Workflow

### Complete Mac Rebuild
1. **Preparation**

   - Install additional software as needed

### Selective Migration
For moving specific configurations to a new system:
